# Battleship - Client


## Prerequisites and Installation

For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

This command will start the app and make it available on http://localhost:3000

### Build

Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
Once you've built the app, you may test it locally by running `npm run preview` command.

See this section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information
about deployment using Vite.
